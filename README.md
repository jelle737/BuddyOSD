# Project

* Minimosd software for ground buddy osd
* Hardware consist of (two) minimOSD boards with modification.
* Needs two LTM (Lite Telemetry) streams to work where the 'slave' plane is showed on the 'master' osd.
* In my case I used audiomodem https://github.com/kh4/FSK_modem more info here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/n315ybsf1p2nnxg/FSKv2%20assembly.pdf but alternative ways for this telemetry stream migth be used as this hardware is depriciated.
* LTM telemetry is readly available in iNav, setted up in a few clicks.
* **But don't get your hopes up, this is work in progres and not functional at this moment.**
* **It's not a ground OSD in a way that it does not show regular OSD features, only overlays 'friend's plane'**

## Support

* Maybe there will be a wiki in the future.
